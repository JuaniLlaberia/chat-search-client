## Project overview

This repository contains the frontend for interacting with the web search agent. It provides a clean, modern and simple chat interface where users can ask questions, view synthesized answers, and explore citations.

Goals:

* Minimal, responsive chat interface.
* Show answers **with citations** in a transparent way.
* Quick access to follow-up queries.
* Extensible design (works with different backends or LangGraph agents).
